    <h2>&#128181; Introduction to Bitcoin</h2>
    <p>
      Will Bitcoin takeover? A great question indeed. Bitcoin was first created
      in 2009 and has since grown its reputation as the most popular form of
      cryptocurrency globally. At a high level, cryptocurrency is just another
      form of payment and is a means of exchange. Many believe that Bitcoin,
      along with other forms of cryptocurrency can make our current currency
      almost obsolete. Before jumping to any conclusions regarding the future of
      Bitcoin, letâ€™s analyze some of the facts.
    </p>
    <h2>The Difference Between Crypto and Regular Currency</h2>
    <p>
      The primary difference between crypto and the form of currency we are
      familiar with today is that crypto is decentralized while the modern
      currency is centralized. Centralized means that all the money is regulated
      by a certain entity. In our case, this is the government. However, in the
      case of Bitcoin or any other form of cryptocurrency, it is decentralized
      which means that there is no singular entity that regulates the money.
      Instead (I will use Bitcoin in my explanation), Bitcoin relies on
      peer-to-peer transactions. In other words, people themselves associated a
      value to Bitcoin for trading, not the government. With this in mind, a
      serious problem arises. As there is no sole regulation by the government,
      how does Bitcoin remain secure?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where the field of Blockchain comes into play. You most likely
      have heard this term come up at least once in a conversation. Blockchain
      is a growing field and has had many great strides in the past few years.
      The basic idea of blockchain is in the name. When a transaction is
      completed, a block is created in the system, storing the information for
      the given transaction. This block is then added to a chain of blocks. Now,
      around the world, multiple computers are dealing with crypto and so all
      these computers verify that this transaction is legit and not someone just
      faking it. The actual math behind this is somewhat complicated but is an
      integral part of security in modern systems. The basic idea is that
      computers are forced to solve math problems involving large numbers to get
      some information from the system.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Isn't Everyone Already Using Crypto?</h2>
    <p>
      Now you might be thinking that crypto is the perfect solution for
      transacting money, but some major issues must be overcome before we can
      make cryptocurrency mainstream. The main problem arises with scalability.
      As more people begin to trade cryptocurrency, there is a large amount of
      latency due to the number of computers responsible for verifying a block
      is valid. This results in a theoretical limit on the number of Bitcoins
      that can be traded in a given day. Currently, the total number of bitcoins
      that can be traded stands at a little less than 600,000. This means that
      on any given day, the most number of Bitcoin transactions that can be made
      is very limited. We can compare this with the economy as a whole. In the
      US alone, there are at minimum tens of millions of transactions that occur
      daily. As a result, we can claim that the current systems in place are not
      advanced enough for crypto to be the next dollar bill. That being said,
      Bitcoin only came out in 2009, and since then, great steps have been made
      in the field.

      Furthermore, there is also an issue of security. Since no one is
      regulating it, it makes it that little bit easier to hack. Additionally,
      it makes trading in the black market a little easier too for the same
      reason.
    </p>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      So coming back to the main question: will Bitcoin takeover? For me, the
      answer is not anytime soon. Although, in my opinion, Bitcoin is this great
      feat of science and finance, it is still in its very preliminary stages.
      There is a long long way to go before we can start accepting crypto as the
      normal form of currency. As I mentioned before, there is a theoretical
      limit on the amount of Bitcoin that can be traded each day. In the next 50
      years or so, if we start to see more growth (and more likely than not we
      will) in the speeds at which these computers can run and how well they can
      work in parallel with each other, then the theoretical limit on the amount
      of Bitcoin we can trade will eventually grow as well. But, once again, I
      believe this will take some time.
