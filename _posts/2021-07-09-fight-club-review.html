      This book is written by <strong>Chuck Palahniuk</strong> and was published
      by <strong>W. W. Norton & Company</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>&#128216; Quick Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The book starts off with our protagionist, an insomniac whose name is
      never metioned throughout the book. To cope with his disease, he attends
      support groups, faking different illnesses to fit in. Supposedly, this is
      a temporary cure to his problem (even after finishing the book, I found
      this to be a tad strange). There he meets Marla, another attendee who also
      seems to be faking her illnesses. The only difference is that Marla
      doesn't have any true purpose for attending this meetings besides
      "entertainment". As time goes on, we learn that the Narrator is stuck in a
      mundane job and feels like he has no purpose in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is then that our main character meets Tyler Durden, a slightly
      over-the-top character who convinced the Narrator to start a fight club
      with him. This idea comes from the fact that neither had ever been in a
      fight, and in a fight, all external worries become obsolete. The rush of
      adreneline takes over their body and in those ten minutes, people who were
      nobodies in the real world were "living gods" in Fight Club. This is where
      the famous phrase "the first rule of fight club is you do not talk about
      fight club" comes from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, the fight club evolves and more people begin to join it. The
      Narrator talks about consistently running into people with bruises and
      scars at work going about their day as normal. To the outside world, those
      scars are a result of some accident. Only those in Fight Club know the
      real reason. Additonally, we learn that Tyler is into the business of
      making soap. When the Narrator first sees him doing this, they get into a
      diccussion on the chemistry of soaps and how you can potentially take the
      same ingredients to make dangerous explosives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skipping ahead a little, we start to see some things go out of control.
      Tyler begins to take on a more anarchist persona as he promots people to
      join an origanization called Project Mayhem. This project is basically a
      child of Fight Club and is responsible for the destruction of society.
      Tyler makes himself to be someone ridding the world of the unnesscary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As things get much worse, the Narrator decides to talk with Tyler, to tell
      him that this needs to stop. However, he cannot find Tyler anywhere. This
      is where the infamous twist comes. As the Narrator is travelling city to
      city trying to find Tyler, he is greeted by bartenders as "sir", something
      they would only call Tyler. They also know about "Tyler's kiss", a
      chemical burn from a mixture of soap ingredients that leaves quite the
      mark. Confused, the Narrator decides to talk with Marla. It is then that
      Marla calls the Narrator "Tyler". The big twist is revealed: Tyler and the
      Narrator are the same person! Tyler is merely a result of the Narrator's
      insomnia. When the Narrator is asleep, Tyler is awake and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story continues, and at one point, they are at the top of the
      building. The Narrator comes to the relization that he must die to stop
      not only Tyler but the horrid/mundane life he is living. Marla tries to
      stop him, but it is too late. The novel ends with a reflection on what is
      the purpose of life. From Heaven, the Narrator looks down at Marla, who
      misses him more each day. A sad ending indeed, but one that puts the
      cherry on top.

    <h2>&#128269; Personal Thoughts and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This books has to be one of my top five favorite books that I have read.
      The story, although so foreign and strange, somehow makes me feel
      connected to the main protagonist. When reading the book, you notice all
      the things in the life that you do despite not wanting to do them. I came
      into this book thinking it would be about a bunch of men fighting each
      other for power. I could not be more wrong. The story develops a profound
      sense of "what is the purpose of life" and "why is it that we do what we
      do"? The main character is stuck in this horrible cycle that he cannot get
      out of. He describes it as the "IKEA catalog" (not sure if those are the
      exact words) lifestyle. To elaborate, he means that everything in his life
      is designed to be just like the catalog. In my opinon, this is a greater
      metaphor for how our life is designed by others to be something that, from
      a society's perspective, is "good". There are many references of this
      throughout the book in conversations between the Narrator and Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyler is bascially a critique of this notion. He believes that we need to
      live more on the edge. Now, while I don't condone most of what Tyler lives
      for, I see his point. Throughout the book, we learn that Tyler has an
      aversion towards the rich, most likely a result of them rpactically
      controlling other lives and telling them how to act. Tyler's rebelious
      nature sends the message that we need to live more freely. There are
      several parts of the book that Tyler is the most free he can be from
      capturing the police comissioner and holding him hostage to stealing from
      a hospital (I won't go into too many details as it's a little bit much
      &#128514;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there's also a very interesting character of Marla. At the beginning
      of book, I found it difficult to read what type of character she was. She
      seemed so indifferent of her surroundings. In the beginning, Marla was
      saved by Tyler ("the Narrator"), from taking her life. As time progresses,
      she grows fond of our main character. Ironically, at the end, the roles
      reverse, but unfortunately, Marla cannot do much to save the protagionist.
      My initial thought was that Marla was the character to reveal the twist at
      the end, but looking back, I think there is much more to it. Marla is not
      scared of death. In fact, she sometimes welcomes it (yes, if you haven't
      already noticed by now, this is a very dark book indeed). In my opinion,
      Marla is a smaller version of Tyler. She doesn't care what happens to her
      and just lives life as she pleases. She steal others clothes, smokes, and
      goes to support groups for entertainment. In other words, she has already
      accepted the fact that one day, fate will take her and there is nothing
      anyone can do about it. However, one can argue that to an extent this
      changes towards the end of the novel, but for the most part, this is just
      my opinion of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this book was absolutely great! That being said, if you are
      reading this analysis and you haven't already the book and you felt queasy
      simply hearing about it, skip the book. The book goes into A LOT more
      detail. From a literature standpoint, the impact this book has goes beyond
      just Fight Club. In fact, Fight Club is probably the smallest aspect of
      the book. When reading this book, I was addicted to finding what certain
      aspects of the book meant. But I won't talk more about it since "the first
      rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club."
