      As part of the Data Structures: Honors course at UT Austin, one of the
      projects was to build a webcrawler. As an example, Google’s search engine
      is one of the most notable public Webcrawlers. Similar to Google’s
      webcrawler, our webcrawler had to have the ability to search through large
      amounts files in a managable time-frame. Using the knowledge I had gained
      throughout the semester, I successfully completed the project.
