    <h2>RSR (Regression and Successive Rejects)</h2>
    <p>
      Efficient hyperparameter optimization methods are crucial for current
      machine learning problems since evaluating different configurations is
      expensive. Popular hyperparameter tuning methods such as Bayesian
      Optimization perform well in low-dimensional (n < 5) scenarios yet
      gradually become slower as n increases. Similarly, algorithms dependent on
      random search and early-stopping, although relatively quick, do not prove
      to be as robust. RSR uses multi-armed bandits and regression to better
      predict stronger configurations in shorter periods. Additionally, due to
      RSRâ€™s ability to adapt to different situations (i.e., testing with a
      different number of resources), the algorithm can effectively be used for
      all hyperparameter tuning. I was nominated as a national scholar for the
