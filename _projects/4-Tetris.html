    <h2>Tetris</h2>
    <p>
      As part of the Data Structures: Honors course at UT Austin, one of the
      projects was to build a tetris clone. This Tetris clone had to have all
      the functionalities of the original Tetris game, including shifts,
      rotations, colored blocks. Additionally, the game was created with wall
      jumps, a more advanced feature of Tetris. Furthermore, I created a genetic
      algorithm capable of playing the game successfully.
