    <h2>Robosuite NViSII Integration</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://robosuite.ai/">Robosuite</a>
      is a simulation framework that allows researchers to develop algorithms
      for robot learning. The software is made possible by collaborators from
      both Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin. My
      contribution to the project involved creating a wrapper class the
      integrates the
      <a href="https://github.com/owl-project/NVISII">NViSII</a>
      renderer, a ray tracing based renderer, with the original software. By
      having a higher quality renderer, models which are trained using Robosuite
      will prove to be more accurate when tested in real-life situations.
